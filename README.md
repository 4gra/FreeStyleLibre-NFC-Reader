Please direct all attention to [vicktor/FreeStyleLibre-NFC-Reader](vicktor/FreeStyleLibre-NFC-Reader)

Obviously all are welcome to use what's here but be aware it might be _significantly_ behind the upstream master, so it's not the upstream authors' responsibility to help with this old branch.

### SI Units

One notable and unfinished difference (which I should probably form into a pull request) was the conversion to SI units (mmol/l, rather than mg/dl commonly used in the US).  This conversion is based on the molecular weight of glucose and is just as explained in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar#Units:

    1 / 18 = 0.05555555556
